Algorithm tries to find a suitable function in order for a robot to use it for its navigation system. At the start we know what some inpute with their specific output values should be. With this we try to approximate the function to apply it.

The algorithm is an evolutionary one and uses a graph representation with variables being terminals and operators being functions.
